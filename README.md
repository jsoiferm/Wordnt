# Wordnt
Wordn't is a word game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to spell as many words as possible, without repeating, that start with the letter displayed on the screen. A letter from A-Z is randomly displayed every 20 seconds, and the user has two minutes total to spell as many words as they can. The Datamuse API is used to check whether each word is a valid English word, which was accessed using the JavaScript "Fetch" API. To play the game, download all the files, access the files in Visual Studio Code, and run the live server in a browser.
