    <p class="Instructions">Welcome to Wordn't! Spell as many words as you can before two minutes elapse. When the game begins,
        a letter will appear on your screen. Type words that start with this letter into the white input box, and press either 
        the "Enter" key or the "Submit" button on the screen to submit your word. But be careful! Every 20 seconds, the letter on 
        the screen may change! You gain points by spelling words that start with the displayed letter. The longer the word, the more 
        points you are awarded (100 points per letter). However, if you spell a word wrong, spell a word you already submitted, 
        spell a nonexistant word, or spell a word that starts with the wrong letter, you will lose 100 points (gasp)! That's all there
        is to it, so good luck and have fun!
